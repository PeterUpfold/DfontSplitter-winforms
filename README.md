This program allows you to convert many Mac OS X .dfont file into the TTF files that Windows can make use of.

This is currently a **work-in-progress** improvement to the existing .NET 2.0 based application.

Please note you should only perform this process on fonts that you have the right to use. You are solely responsible for your actions with this program.
